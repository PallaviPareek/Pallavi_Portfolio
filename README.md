# Pallavi's Portfolio

Hello, Iâ€™m **Pallavi Pareek** â€” a Data Science graduate student at the University of North Texas.  

Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems by turning raw data into meaningful insights and building scalable software solutions. My journey bridges both worlds: from developing intuitive full-stack applications and managing complex databases, to creating data pipelines, dashboards, and predictive models. I thrive on working real time data to deliver systems that are not only functional, but also insightful and impactful.
